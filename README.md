# ANSYS-APDL-subroutine-CZM-uncoupled-model
ANSYS Mechanical APDL subroutine to define cohesive laws obtained by linear or polynomial interpolation of the respective points entered using the TBDATA command. The purpose of this subroutine is to define cohesive laws of any shape in ANSYS by means of the linear or polynomial interpolation of a given set of interpolating points of the cohesive laws, in particular for each Modes it is possible to choose a different number of points that are not necessarily equal spaced apart. By means of linear interpolation, the cohesive law is defined by an initial linear elastic section and by a softening branch consisting of linear sections. By means of polynomial interpolation, the cohesive law is defined by an initial linear section and by a polynomial softening branch .This cohesive zone model is intrinsic model, unilateral effect (i.e. the difference in tensile and compressive behavior in the direction normal to the interface plane  in Mode I) is took in account, while the through-thickness compressive stress effect is ignored. This CZM is developed for non-linear static analysis.
